A character with mobility issues can gain this device upon character creation for free. There are no additional benefits or penalties associated with using one. It has its own built-in steam power which cannot be used to fuel other abilities. Unlike other forms of Steam Armour, armour or a Steam source can be worn over it or combined with it. Steam Armour can also be designed to accommodate a mobility suit. Biomechanical limbs can be adapted for use with this suit. Mobility suits often take the form of wheeled chairs or multi-legged prostheses; in these cases a wide array of mechanical tools and gadgets are built in to allow the user to do anything a typical person not in need of this device could do such as climb or balance.\nThis device has a price of 7 if purchased outside of character creation.\n","guard":"","strength":"","agility":"","fuel":"","max steam":""}}
