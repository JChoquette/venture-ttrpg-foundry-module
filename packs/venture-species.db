Their leathery grey skin and oversized teeth verging on tusks protruding from their lower jaw serve only to make them even more imposing, giving truth to the adage that humans will hate that which they fear."}}

Distinguishing features include less prominent primary feathers, a more upright posture, and shorter tails than their Nassami counterparts. They form much larger societies than is typical for saurians, and have constructed sizeable cities throughout the Darklands, relying on a mixture of agriculture and hunting to survive. Though not comparable to modern human cities, it is not uncommon for the population to reach into the tens of thousands. Evidence of even larger abandoned cities has spurred speculation of a once-great empire brought down by the Xatharians long ago."}}

A stockier build is a distinguishing factor of gnomes, as well as a propensity for being elbow deep in whatever new and probably dangerous contraption their whimsy and genius have colluded to create."}}

If you include downward movement, may increase your range.","community":"Nassami Culture and Saurian Language","description":"Smaller than their Hylarian cousins, and far more heavily feathered, Nassami saurians are nimble hunters, and can even fly to a small degree. A more inclined posture allows for a quicker gait, and the Nassam are swift both physically and mentally. Unlike the Hylar, the Nassam eschew nearly all agriculture in favour of hunting, figuring something which doesn't try to run away probably isn't worth eating. These excellent hunters employ stealth and poisons in order to capture prey, and none are better at surviving against the dangerous predators of the Darklands, in such a list could reasonably be topped by the Nassami saurians themselves."}}

Because of their long lives and adherence to old ways, most elves who do intermingle have great difficulty adapting to an ever-changing world, and are often met with suspicion. There is variety within any species however, and some elves find themselves welcomed or even placed on a pedestal by other species."}}

Their slightly pointed ears, lithe build, and the thick fur on the bottom of their feet distinguish them from gnomes. Quick and likeable, halflings are masters of remaining unseen by `big folk'. Though rarely hardened criminals or killers, a life of petty thieving comes naturally to halflings with a flexible morality."}}

Indeed, gender itself is not considered something to be make an issue of, and is far less interesting to a dwarf than, say, a good vein of silver or some some well chiseled stonework."}}
