The magic which harnesses the power of the spirit plane is one of the oldest forms of magic. Every culture has their own musings on the spirits, with some believing that they were the ancestors or the beginning of life themselves. Others believe that the spirits arise naturally and dwell in their own reality largely unconnected from ours, so far beyond our comprehension that we may never understand them.\nSpirits are not good or evil, but are instead just as complex as any living organism. Some can be benign, others parasitize living beings, and still others can be malignant. They are often tied to locations or objects, and can be influenced by the material plane. Many spirit magic practitioners specialize in pacifying or subduing angered spirits, or in assisting those parasitized or preyed upon by the more malignant spirits.\nA good spirit mage can also learn to call upon some spirits by making offerings to them. This typically takes the form of burning Spiritweed incense, made a rare medicinal plant, for your spells.The GM may allow you to make bonds with other spirits or appease them through other means.\nMany spells will require spiritweed, which can be obtained through your providers during your downtime, or by foraging in the wilderness or visiting other spirit magic practitioners instead of resting (1 hour). It is not sold; it is freely given and traded between practitioners, though sometimes a gift is exchanged. Spiritweed that is sold or bartered for becomes inert.\n"}}
