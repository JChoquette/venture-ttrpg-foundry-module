This is by no means universal; many Orcish clans still hold blood mages in high regard -- though admittedly one doesn't have much choice but to respect someone when the alternative is having four liters of your blood yanked out of your body.\nBlood magic is fueled primarily by the caster's own body, with the price paid in blood. This price can, however, be paid by another creature in your area. Whenever a blood spell causes you to gain the Bleeding condition you can instead make a sacrifice, causing a creature in your area who is either willing, fully restrained, or unconscious to gain the condition instead.\nSome blood spells impose the Bleeding condition on a foe or require a foe to have that condition beforehand. Creatures without blood, such as spirits or automatons, are immune to the condition and can therefore not be the target of these spells."}}
