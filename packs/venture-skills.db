Many of the spells in this category involve creating a companion through the process of binding a persona to it: Minor Binding, Elemental Binding, Grave Binding, and Eviction Binding. There are two ways to do this: with a bound persona or an unbound persona.\nUnbound personas can be thought of as free-floating personas that exist in the world, and their exact source is unclear. Some theorize they are the personas of those who have died recently, held together briefly before slowly disintegrating. Others believe they manifest at random or even as a byproduct the personas of living beings, and may even be the precursors to spirits. Whichever theory is correct, these personas are plentiful and can be temporarily bound to a physical form to allow you to cast the mentioned spells as Maintained spells. When you cease maintaining the spell, the persona once again becomes unbound and the spell ends.\nThe second, and much more controversial, method is to use a Bound Persona, the persona of a recently deceased individual that has been trapped to form a persona crystal. When you use a binding spell in this manner, it takes an hour to cast and you must use a persona crystal gained through the Bind Persona spell. The effect is then permanent until the companion is destroyed. Binding spells created in this way do not need to be maintained, but do still require some care. You may only keep control of permanent companions created this way with a combined level less than or equal to your skill ranks. Directing one to take a turn in combat requires that you spend a Fast action."}}

Curses are a retributive form of magic that exploit the worst thoughts within a creature, and are almost always used to harm. They are therefore frowned upon and generally taught in secret.\nBecause the curse is retributive, it can usually only be cast as punishment for some transgression: the victim of your curse must have wronged you or an ally in some way. Exactly what constitutes a transgression is up to you and your GM, but generally acts of aggression, theft, trespass, or harm all count. If an enemy is in combat with you and has attacked in that combat, this is sufficient to be a transgression. If you attempt to cast a curse on someone who has not wronged you, then if your target successfully defends against the curse you must also defend or be subject to the curse yourself.\nCurses are permanent, but can be removed by other practitioners. During a rest, instead of resting, you may use your Curse skill to attempt to remove a curse from someone. This requires a check vs the Curse skill of the original caster. On a failure, you may not attempt it again until the following day.\nCurses are cast either as a Reaction or as a Slow action. They can be cast as a reaction to you or your allies being attacked.\nMost curses have a `Special' trigger: an additional effect that is triggered if the certain conditions are met by the victim, typically related to the manner in which they have transgressed against you."}}

The magic which harnesses the power of the spirit plane is one of the oldest forms of magic. Every culture has their own musings on the spirits, with some believing that they were the ancestors or the beginning of life themselves. Others believe that the spirits arise naturally and dwell in their own reality largely unconnected from ours, so far beyond our comprehension that we may never understand them.\nSpirits are not good or evil, but are instead just as complex as any living organism. Some can be benign, others parasitize living beings, and still others can be malignant. They are often tied to locations or objects, and can be influenced by the material plane. Many spirit magic practitioners specialize in pacifying or subduing angered spirits, or in assisting those parasitized or preyed upon by the more malignant spirits.\nA good spirit mage can also learn to call upon some spirits by making offerings to them. This typically takes the form of burning Spiritweed incense, made a rare medicinal plant, for your spells.The GM may allow you to make bonds with other spirits or appease them through other means.\nMany spells will require spiritweed, which can be obtained through your providers during your downtime, or by foraging in the wilderness or visiting other spirit magic practitioners instead of resting (1 hour). It is not sold; it is freely given and traded between practitioners, though sometimes a gift is exchanged. Spiritweed that is sold or bartered for becomes inert.\n"}}
