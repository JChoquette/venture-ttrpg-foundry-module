They are still visible, however no importance is attached to their presence. Stealth checks or checks made to blend in can be made with Illusion while the rune is active. If an affected creature purposely interacts with another, for example by addressing them directly, the illusion is broken for that creature only, though aggressive acts or other acts that draw particular attention will break the spell entirely.","domain":"Arcana","costtype":"vim","skill_id":"illusion"}}

The effectiveness depends on how much the implanted memory diverges from the truth. For example, a person may quickly discount a memory that conflicts greatly with their other memories, such as if the memory is `I am your friend' but they also have a memory of you just recently attacking them. On the other hand, implanting a memory that `You promised to pay us 250 Jarn each for the job' (when they actually promised 150) may never be recognized as a false memory, though a greatly unresonable price likely will.","domain":"Arcana","costtype":"vim","skill_id":"illusion"}}
