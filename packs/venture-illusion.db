The effectiveness depends on how much the implanted memory diverges from the truth. For example, a person may quickly discount a memory that conflicts greatly with their other memories, such as if the memory is `I am your friend' but they also have a memory of you just recently attacking them. On the other hand, implanting a memory that `You promised to pay us 250 Jarn each for the job' (when they actually promised 150) may never be recognized as a false memory, though a greatly unresonable price likely will.","roll_type":"","domain":"Arcana","costtype":"vim","skill_id":"illusion"}}
