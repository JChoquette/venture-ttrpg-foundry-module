Attack rolls with explosives or inhaled drugs are made with the Alchemy skill.\nYou may use your Alchemy skill to craft your own poisons, drugs, and explosives with rank less than or equal to your skill ranks using Alchemical Supplies. This takes one hour per item created. Alchemy Supplies can be purchased in most settlements with a price of 1, or you can spend an hour searching in areas of wilderness to find a number equal to half the result of the check. You may safely carry Alchemy Supplies equal to double your Alchemy ranks. \nAlchemical creations tend to be dangerous and fragile. The items you create yourself must be well-cared for, and you may only carry a number equal to your skill ranks; they can also only be safely used by someone with sufficent ranks. When you purchase alchemical items from a store, they are stable and made to be administered or used by anyone and do not count toward your maximum."}}
