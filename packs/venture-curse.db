Curses are a retributive form of magic that exploit the worst thoughts within a creature, and are almost always used to harm. They are therefore frowned upon and generally taught in secret.\nBecause the curse is retributive, it can usually only be cast as punishment for some transgression: the victim of your curse must have wronged you or an ally in some way. Exactly what constitutes a transgression is up to you and your GM, but generally acts of aggression, theft, trespass, or harm all count. If an enemy is in combat with you and has attacked in that combat, this is sufficient to be a transgression. If you attempt to cast a curse on someone who has not wronged you, then if your target successfully defends against the curse you must also defend or be subject to the curse yourself.\nCurses are permanent, but can be removed by other practitioners. During a rest, instead of resting, you may use your Curse skill to attempt to remove a curse from someone. This requires a check vs the Curse skill of the original caster. On a failure, you may not attempt it again until the following day.\nCurses are cast either as a Reaction or as a Slow action. They can be cast as a reaction to you or your allies being attacked.\nMost curses have a `Special' trigger: an additional effect that is triggered if the certain conditions are met by the victim, typically related to the manner in which they have transgressed against you."}}
