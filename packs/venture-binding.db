Many of the spells in this category involve creating a companion through the process of binding a persona to it: Minor Binding, Elemental Binding, Grave Binding, and Eviction Binding. There are two ways to do this: with a bound persona or an unbound persona.\nUnbound personas can be thought of as free-floating personas that exist in the world, and their exact source is unclear. Some theorize they are the personas of those who have died recently, held together briefly before slowly disintegrating. Others believe they manifest at random or even as a byproduct the personas of living beings, and may even be the precursors to spirits. Whichever theory is correct, these personas are plentiful and can be temporarily bound to a physical form to allow you to cast the mentioned spells as Maintained spells. When you cease maintaining the spell, the persona once again becomes unbound and the spell ends.\nThe second, and much more controversial, method is to use a Bound Persona, the persona of a recently deceased individual that has been trapped to form a persona crystal. When you use a binding spell in this manner, it takes an hour to cast and you must use a persona crystal gained through the Bind Persona spell. The effect is then permanent until the companion is destroyed. Binding spells created in this way do not need to be maintained, but do still require some care. You may only keep control of permanent companions created this way with a combined level less than or equal to your skill ranks. Directing one to take a turn in combat requires that you spend a Fast action."}}
